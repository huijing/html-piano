# HTML5 piano

I was bored one Saturday and decided to build a HTML piano. Simply because I felt like it. 

## Basic setup
1. `git clone git@github.com:huijing/blank-html5.git`
2. `npm install`
3. `gulp`

- Styles go in the styles.scss file, and will be compiled by Gulp
- Scripts go into the js folder, and will be concatenated by Gulp
